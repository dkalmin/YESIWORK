# Welcome to Valet labs!
These Valet labs let you test-drive Valet by bootstrapping the environment of your choosing. Below are the specific functions of the labs.

## Bootstrap your environment
The first step toward setting up a bootstrapped environment is to choose what platform to run Valet against. Currently these labs support Azure DevOps. The default page of the lab of your choosing will detail how to configure and run the action to bootstrap the environment.  

## Configure and run Codespaces
After you have an environment bootstrapped, you run Valet via Codespaces. The codespace has docker running and will update to the latest Valet environment.

## Labs
Once you have a bootstrapped environment and Valet running via Codespaces, you can proceed to the labs. 

## Environments to bootstrap
- [Azure DevOps](azure_devops)
- [Jenkins](jenkins)
